I primarily selected the bubble sort algorithm, not just because it is one of the simplest algorithsm to use and is readily available, but also because I had done similar sorting projects in a previous course and had used this algorithm there.

While I didn't encounter too many difficulties with performing this lab, with the entire process from initial design to implementation going relatively smoothly, I did encounter some minor issues that were primarily human error such as typos, incorrect variables, or bloated unnecessary extras in the code.
