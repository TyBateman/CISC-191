I didn't have really any notable challenges in this lab, mostly just the typical process of figuring out exactly how to perform it.

```java

public class Person {
   private int ageYears;
   private String lastName;

   public void setName(String userName) {
      lastName  = userName;
   }

   public void setAge(int numYears) {
      ageYears = numYears;
   }

   public void printAll() {
      System.out.print("Name: " + lastName);
      System.out.print(", Age: "  + ageYears);
   }
}

public class Student extends Person {
   private int idNum;

   public void setID(int studentId) {
      idNum = studentId;
   }

   public int getID() {
      return idNum;
   }
}

public class StudentDerivationFromPerson {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Student courseStudent = new Student();

      courseStudent.setName("Smith");
      courseStudent.setAge(20);
      courseStudent.setID(9999);

      courseStudent.printAll();

      System.out.println(", ID: " + courseStudent.getID());
   }
}

```
