# Introduction

The main challenge I had in performing this lab was the lack of specifically detailed instructions as was the case in the past labs. While this is in no way a bad thing and an important addition to increase my own coding prowess, it does add a degree of difficulty to the lab.

```java
class Person {
    int id;
    String name;

    public Person(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
}

public class PersonBuilder {
    private static Person buildPerson(int id, String name) {
        return new Person(id, name);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int id = 23;
        String name = "John";
        Person person = null;
        person = buildPerson(id, name);
    }
}
```
