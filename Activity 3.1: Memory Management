The main challenge I had in performing this lab was the lack of specifically detailed instructions as was the case in the past labs. While this is in no way a bad thing and an important addition to increase my own coding prowess, it does add a degree of difficulty to the lab.

```java

class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
    
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Person Object is Garbage Collected: " + name);
    }
}

```

```java

public class MemoryDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p1 = new Person("Jerry", 25);
        Person p2 = new Person("Larry", 30);
        
        p1.display();
        p2.display();
        
        p1 = null;
        p2 = new Person("Barry", 35);
        
        System.gc();
        Person p3 = new Person("Mary", 40);
        p3.display();
    }
}

```
